> **Archived (March 2026)** — This project originated as a university group project in October 2020 and was actively developed through early 2021. The dev environment was modernized in March 2026 (Nix flake, Docker-based Firebase emulators) to ensure the project remains buildable, but no further feature work is planned. Archiving for portfolio preservation.

## Features

- Two-role system: **Providers** offer items, **Receivers** browse and request trades
- Post creation with image uploads and paginated browsing
- Offer management — accept, decline, and review trades
- Location-based services with geocoding
- Firebase-backed authentication, Firestore database, and Cloud Storage
- Firebase Emulator support for local development

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) — provides JDK 11, Android SDK, Android emulator, and Gradle
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) — runs Firebase emulators
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) (recommended) — auto-activates the dev environment on `cd`

### Setup

```bash
# One-time: allow direnv (auto-activates on cd)
direnv allow
```

If you don't use direnv, run `nix develop` manually to enter the dev shell.

A dummy `google-services.json` is included for local development — debug builds connect to Firebase emulators, so real credentials aren't needed.

### Development

```bash
nix run .#emulator &     # Launch Android emulator (background)
./gradlew emulators &    # Start Firebase emulators (background)
./gradlew dev            # Build + install + seed test data
```

`./gradlew dev` runs `installDebug` + `seed` together. The seed script creates two test accounts and sample posts in the Firebase emulators.

### Available Tasks

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| `nix run .#emulator` | Launch the Android emulator |
| `./gradlew emulators` | Start Firebase emulators (via Docker) |
| `./gradlew seed` | Seed Firebase emulators with test data |
| `./gradlew dev` | Build + install + seed (all-in-one) |
| `./gradlew test` | Run unit tests |
| `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` | Run instrumented tests |
| `./gradlew assembleDebug` | Build debug APK |
| `./gradlew assembleRelease` | Build release APK |

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
./gradlew test

# Instrumented tests (requires Android emulator + Firebase emulators running)
# Set test credentials in gradle.properties:
#   TEST_EMAIL=your-test@example.com
#   TEST_PASSWORD=YourTestPass123!
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Architecture

Clean Architecture + MVVM with the following layers:

```
View → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → DataSource
```

| Layer | Directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Presentation | `presentation/` | Fragments, ViewModels, Adapters |
| Domain | `domain/` | Use Cases, Models, Repository interfaces |
| Data | `data/` | Repository implementations, Data Sources, Firestore models |
| DI | `di/` | Manual dependency injection via factory pattern |
| Utils | `utils/` | Handlers, validation, location services |

## Configuration

### Firebase Emulators

Run via Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`), configured in `firebase.json`:

| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| Auth | 9099 |
| Firestore | 8080 |
| Storage | 9199 |
| Emulator UI | 4000 |

Debug builds automatically connect to emulators at `10.0.2.2` (Android emulator loopback).

### Build Variants

- **Debug**: Connects to Firebase emulators, cleartext allowed to localhost
- **Release**: R8 minification enabled, cleartext blocked, ProGuard rules applied
